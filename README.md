# Book ePub Template

This is a basic template to start a new electronic book project.

> [!NOTE]
> I used **[Sigil](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil)**, a multi-platform EPUB ebook editor, to create my own ePubs.

> [!TIP]
> I highly recommend installing **Sigil** (and its xhtml editor, **PageEdit**, if it's your first time writing in xhtml) to get started with your first ebook project. If you need some help with your first steps in Sigil (and you speak spanish), you could visit [**Tutorial de Sigil en espa√±ol**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMdoCO6yLSw7iIxQu0v_TDx4AMUm-TP6g&si=6jlAakQwetgZkU90) in YouTube.
